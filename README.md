### What is this repository for? ###

### How to use this repository? ###
* At the master branch there is a main version of the app, you can download it and install apk on your telephone
using either Android Studio or manually using the gradle script (gradlew)
* Below is the description of other available versions:

1) ScrollingFeature branch (https://bitbucket.org/gubarsergey/matrixandroidtask/branch/feature/scrollingfeature) is the version of the app which works in a bit different way, than the main version, but has a fancy animation of the items appearance.

2) MatrixFeature branch (https://bitbucket.org/gubarsergey/matrixandroidtask/branch/feature/matrixview) is the version that uses the completely different approach, so that here delay of item appearance can be entered manually by user, and the spiral matrix will appear one cell by another.

3) CanvasFeature branch (https://bitbucket.org/gubarsergey/matrixandroidtask/branch/feature/canvasfeature) uses another approach, so that it doesn't render a lot of views, it just draws rectangles and fills it with text using the canvas.
